<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In most parts of the world, integration of renewable and sustainable sources into energy systems is actively ongoing, both in the commercial and consumer sectors. The reasons for this could be the increasing costs of traditional resources, the insecurity of the supply, or the need for cleaner and more sustainable source of energy. However, energy management system (EMS) products available on the market are not always flexible enough to adapt to the changing circumstances and aren&rsquo;t able to fulfill the continuously changing requirements. Most products cannot co-operate with other manufacturers&rsquo; devices or new, previously unavailable technologies that emerge and shape the market on a monthly basis. Very often we find that devices cannot implement special features that are required to optimise efficiency, or in some cases lacking even basic, necessary features to operate complex energy systems safely and reliably.</p>
<h2 id="about-sivula">About Sivula</h2>
<p>Our company has over 10 years of experience in energy systems and the operation, monitoring and control of all related devices. Our proprietary software infrastructure allows us to quickly and easily integrate any necessary components into new or existing energy systems that have any type of digital communication interface, collect data from these devices and use any collected data points to control and automate any available parameters of the system. Using our product, we were able to quickly, efficiently, economically and reliably solve countless problems that were previously thought to be impossible. We were able to make a positive change in over 20 countries around the world, we&rsquo;ve taken part in research and development, improved the lives of people, contributed to the development and sustainability of many various industries, contributed to improving the reliability of the global food chain. Due to the ever increasing demand and the complexity of our new projects, we are looking forward to welcome a new member in our team.</p>
<h2 id="job-description">Job Description</h2>
<p>The new colleague will be involved in the integration of energy system components via industrial communication protocols, the design, implementation, testing and performance analisys of control algorithms, the maintenance and operation of the embedded Linux computer software and the commissioning of the energy system communication infrastructure via remote access during installations.</p>
<p>This area is new and requires a wide range of knowledge and experience for efficient work, but the possession of these is not a requirement, as long as the candidate is interested in this technology, has some fundamental knowledge in some of the areas and can pick up new skills and knowledge quickly. The language of communication in the company is English, at least intermediate written and spoken skill is required. It is also necessary to have a good understanding of the fundamentals of electricity, at least user level knowledge of Linux systems and at least intermediate Python programming skills. It is an advantage if the candidate has experience or interest in the areas of sustainable energy systems, control/regulation algorithms, data processing/analysis, standard and non-standard industrial communication protocols (CAN, Modbus, DNP3, etc.) and Yocto Linux/Bitbake.</p>
<p>Our team is spread across multiple countries and continents, but we all work from home. On demand, we supply any equipment required for work. There will be opportunities to meet up, work together or even gain on-site work experience. Our company culture is very human centric, not profit oriented, free from investor pressure.</p>
